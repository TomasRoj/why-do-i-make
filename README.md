# Why do I make?

Tom√°≈° Roj - Opportunity to help other people with their problems using best possible solutions.

Martin Mal√Ω - Making is my passion. I love the feeling I am creating a whole new thing I have created in my mind before.

Konstantin L√°ska - I just enjoy it.

Matƒõj V. - I really love feel that I could make something what I imagine in my head. I could solve problems, make a device to make my life easier or just make something I like.

Kry≈°tof Montilla - As a creators ... We have power to make entire worlds. In my case ... Worlds of Tools. We are not just problem solvers.    Ones and zeros ...  That's our building blocks of living!

Jordi Chin - I just love writing all the functions, variables and especially arrays (I just love them <3)

Vladan Trhl√≠k - I really enjoy planning projects 'from A to Z'. I learned a lot by making projects, and that's why I love it... 

Augustine Tan - I feel immense satisfaction in solving problems with the code I write. There is nothing better than seeing my code work as I had intended, whether it is for a microcontroller, a mobile app, or even a full-sized robot!

Bertik23 - I thought it could be fun so I went to a programming class and it was fun and I started coding things. I really like the problem solving side of things.
